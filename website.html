            <h1>About</h1>
            <h3>I still remember when I got my first Lego set from my parents, shortly after disassembling many objects from around the household without the knowledge of putting it back together. Grasping with what little I knew, it was (and still is) surprising how much can be created with such little foundation, using only a variety of multi-colored blocks of limited configuration. Luckily, I went to Case Western Reserve University, taken a spectrum of courses with their own applications, and now my limits are boundless.</h3>
            <h3>Hello, my name is Ro Jie Li (or just Roger), and I would like to show you how I can be of great importance to you. My major is within bio-medical engineering at Case Western Reserve University, with a concentration on bio-medical computing and analysis. This is further focused towards medical image processing, the area I am most experienced in. My decision in choosing this field is derived from a variety of experiences that helped filter what I enjoy working on. These experiences are explained on here on my website (please take a look if interested), but to summarize quickly, every experience pointed me in a direction, under which the next experience would help further refine what I would (or would not) want to do. </h3>
            <h3>From my educational and professional experiences during my time at CWRU, I have a variety of tools at my disposal. Fluent in Matlab, I am able to do signal processing and dynamic modeling utilizing knowledge from related courses to solve a multitude of problems. I am also experienced in using artificial intelligence in Java for decision making processes. Factor in my education in human physiology, I am able to provide a niche skill-set aimed towards medical image processing.</h3>
            <h3>This specific combination of skills is a result of my research experience at Oakland University, where after a single programming course taken at CWRU, was expected to create a program that could perform medical image processing on tumorous MRI slides. I loved it. The process of performing data analysis using algorithms on data sets in the form of images was a thoroughly enjoyable experience for me. Toying around with information to see if there is any "hidden" information is an art form to me and I love practicing this art. A research paper was written at the end of my experience at Oakland, however due to lack of personal skills and research knowledge, it became evident that much more was needed in order to progress myself into the field. This launched me into the person that I am today, as this experience molded my decision to choose bio computing and analysis.</h3>
            <h3>What I want to do for you is perform data analysis in order to identify unknown relations or characteristics that are not obvious. I enjoy finding trends or information that is not inherently visible from the data itself, but needs some nudging through the process of statistics and algorithms. Software development is what I enjoy doing, and my work is more industrial. The problem does not need to be medically related, however if so I am fully capable of working with it. My language of preference is Matlab however Java and C++ can be worked with as well. </h3>
            <h3>What I can do for you is work in a multitude of engineering positions. My experience at CWRU has made me a well rounded individual with skills in many key engineering fields. My experience also extends towards project management, with additional restrictions to follow FDA regulations. </h3>

            <h1>Project</h1>
            <h3>My projects can be found <a href="https://www.github.com/rojieli" target="_blank">here</a></h3>
            <ul>
               <li>I am currently working on this website, so I am in the process of learning HTML, CSS, Javascript/Jquery, and hope to implement React when I am more familier with the basic languages.</li>
               <li>Another project that is underway is the construction of some hardware coupled with sensors that will capture the distance that my hedgehog Oreo runs every night.</li>
               <li>Some prior projects include the following:
                  <ul>
                     <li>HackCWRU-Hackathon at Case Western Reserve University
                        <ul>
                           <li>Developed a tinder-esque app called Trovi (which is Esperanto for "find") on a team of four that implores the user to interact with others face to face rather than through a chat system. The app was developed for Android use over a period of 36 hours.</li>
                        </ul>
                     </li>
                     <li>Senior Project Design - Case Western Reserve University
                        <ul>
                           <li>Engineering a clinical friendly intrathecal pump with a feedback system in order to be used in a research study. Project spanned various engineering fields such as circuit and hardware design, software (Arduino), and creation of housing for the device. Requires communication with a clinician in order to see what the need is, and using combined skills of the team, solve the need.</li>
